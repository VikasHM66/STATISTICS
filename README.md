# STATISTICS

# Contents.
Repository Containing different Concepts of Statistics for data science and machine learning. This Repository includes Tests of Hypothesis such as One sample Z-test, Two sample Z-test, One sample T-test, Two sample T-test, Z-propotion test, Paired T-test, Unpaired T-test, Chi square test for goodness of fit & chi square tests for Independence, One-way Anova and Two-way Anova test and test to check normality of the data using shapiro test, and to check variances using Levene test.

      [Statistical Analysis on Fifa dataset](https://github.com/VikasHM66/STATISTICS/blob/main/Statistics%20Mini%20Project.ipynb): Performed the statistical analysis on the fifa world cup dataset. The dataset consists of player information which includes height, weight overall rating, potential etc. Data Cleaning and EDA process is been performed. Different Tests of Hypothesis is been performed to know the significance of the features and importance of the features.
